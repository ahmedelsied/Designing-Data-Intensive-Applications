# Data model
## why its important?
- Because all software is about data, how to handle it, how to store it, how to retrieve it, how to display it, how to transform it.
## what is data model ?
- A data model is a conceptual representation of data structures (tables) that are required by a database. It is a way to define and organize the data in a database.
## Data layers
- Layer 0: actual data
  - People
  - Orders
  - Actions
  - Companies
- Layer 1: data model
  - Data structures
  - Objects
- Layer 2: data model stores
  - JSON
  - XML
  - TABLES
  - GRAPHS
- Layer 3: data stores modeling
  - Bytes in ram
  - Files on disk
- Layer 4: hardware data actual
  - E-current
  - Magnetic fields
  - Light pulses
## Data models
- Relational data model
  - purpose
    - Relationships between tables
    - Transactional/Batch processing
    - Business data processing
- Document data model
  - purpose
    - need to greater scalability than relational model
    - widespread preference fpr free and open source software over commercial software
    - Specialized queries operations that are not well supported by relational databases
    - Frustration with the limitations of relational databases
  - issue
    - No standard query language
    - Many to many relationships are not well supported
    - Many to one relationships are not well supported
- Hierarchical data model
  - purpose
    - To represent data in a tree-like structure
    - To represent one-to-many relationships
    - To represent data in a way that is easy to understand
  - issue
    - Not suitable for complex data
    - Not suitable for many-to-many relationships
    - Not suitable for data that changes frequently
- Network data model
  - purpose
    - generalization of the hierarchical model
    - To represent complex data
    - To represent many-to-many relationships
  - issue
    - Not suitable for simple data
    - n-dimensional data space
    - application code complexity
- Relational data model
  - purpose
    - Relationships between tables
    - Transactional/Batch processing
    - Business data processing
  - issue
    - Schema changes are difficult
